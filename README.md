Football Ticket Sale:

An application that allows you to purchase tickets for football games.

Some of the features include:

- User registration
- User login
- Different types of accounts (user, admin)
- Filtering games by date and time, club, by base ticket price
- Purchasing tickets with extra, optional services (picking a seat) for an additional fee
- Integration of Paypal's payment gateway (with a Paypal developer account)
- A system meant to prevent two or more individuals from purchasing a ticket with the same seat and ensuring the number of tickets sold does not exceed the number of total available seats.

Possible additional features (not guaranteed):
- The ability to refund purchases up to 72 hours before a game (only 50% refund)
- A reservation system with a deferred payment (one can reserve a ticket by paying a small non-refundable upfront fee and pay the full amount later)
